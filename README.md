# Demo of sensor-target-tradeoff for accurately classifying an unknown target

In biomolecular interactions, weak stochastic sensing is advantageous for constructing sensors that are capable of uncovering binding kinetics and mechanisms within practical observation times. In fact an array of weak stochastic single molecule sensors that are cross-reactive with a variety of targets is a powerful sensing design that mimics the human olfactory system. It is capable of multiplexed sensing and quantification as we investigate in our paper.

Here, we explore the tradeoff between number of sensors and variety of targets they can accurately classify through two theoretical scenarios:

1. 5 unique but randomized stochastic single molecule sensing elements interacting with a mixture containing 20 unique targets: This scenario addresses if a variety of targets spread over a large dynamic range are distinguishable using a small set of unique sensing elements, especially in presence of measurement noise. The minimum number of unique sensing elements required to distinguish between a set of targets is evaluated in our papar.


2. 80 unique but randomized stochastic single molecule sensing elements interacting with a mixture containing 20 unique targets: This scenario addresses if increasing the dimensionality of the system is favourable for distinguishing the identity of the targets, and if so, to what extent is it beneficial. The maximum limit of sensors that benefit classification is explored in our paper.
